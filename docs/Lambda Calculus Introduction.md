# Lambda Calculus 
**Lambda Calculus** also knows as $\lambda$-**Calculus** is a model of computation developed by _Alonzo Church_ in the 1930s. 

One of the important things it deals with is :-
The way we usually define functions is *Extrinsional*, as in, a function is uniquely defined by the relation it crates between its inputs and outputs, while this way to identify a function is good for most of mathematics, it is important to define the exact way in which a function computes. This problem is solved by lambda calculus making it an *Intrinsional* Syntax for function defintion.
It captures an *intrinsional* definition of a function in its very minimal [[Lambda Calculus Syntax|syntax]] and simple [[Lambda Calculus Evaluation Rules|evaluation rules]].

The interesting thing about **lambda calculus** is that, in the world of lambda calculus, there are **ONLY** functions, no values, no constants...... 
Then what do functions act on?
Other functions!!!

But even with this restrictions, this model of computation is [[Turing Machines#^71be18|Turing Complete]], as in its a **Universal Computation Model**
This was done by finding a set of [[Functions Computable in Lambda Calculus|computable functions]] by $\lambda-$calculus which was later found to be the same as the set of functions computable by Turing Machines.

we can encode [[Church Booleans|Booleans]] and [[Church Numerals|Natural Numbers]] using lambda calculus.

It was used by *Alonzo Church* to solve the **Undecidability Problem** a year before *Alan Turing* did!!
