# Integral Curves
Consider A vector field assigned to a [[Phase Space]]. Given a point in the phase space, we can make a curve that passes through a point, and is tangent to every single vector on the points it passes through. Such a curve is called the **Integral curve** of the direction field.

The name is motivated by the fact that in certain cases they can be found by the process of integration.

The problem of [[Solution of a differential equation|finding an integral curve]] is precisely the problem of integration given a continuous function.

In general the problem of finding integral curve does not reduce to the process of integration. Even for very simply defined direction fields, the equation may not be possible to represent with finitely many integrals and elementary functions.
