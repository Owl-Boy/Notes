# Sub-basis

```ad-note
title: Definition
Let $X$ be a set. Sub-basis $\mathcal{S}$ on $X$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ whose union equals $X$. Topology generated by $S$, $\tau_{\mathcal{S}}$ is the collection of all unions of finite intersections of members of $S$.
```

```ad-note 
title: Lemma
The collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all finite intersections $B = S_1\cap S_2 \cap \cdots \cap S_n$ is a basis on $X$. 

#### Proof:
Covering property holds since it holds for $S$, check that gluing property holds.
