**Differential Equations** greatly contributes to the predictive powers of maths.
Connected Fields
- Linear Algebra
- Number Theory
	- Elliptic curves - $(\wp'(z))^2 = 4\wp(z)^3- g_2\wp(z)-g_3$
	- Transcendence
- Cauchy-Reimann Equations
- Calaby-Yau spaces $\leadsto$ Calabi Flow
- Poincare Conjecture $\leadsto$ Ricci Flow

###  Grading
4 quizzes (best 3) each 10 %
mid term exam - 30 %
final exam - 40 %

Homework is given but not graded

### References
1. ODE- V.I. Arnold(sometimes it gets unmotivaed and its a little terse)
2. Theory of ODE- Coddington and levinson
3. - GF Simmons
4. ODE - Birkhoff and rota (not entirely aligned w the course)
5. Prof. Pramadh Sastry's notes

### Syllabus
Hopefully will get by the end of the course
roughly-
- first and Nth order ODE
- IVP problems (autonomous and non autonomous)
- Lipschitz conditions important for existance and uniqueness theorems
- Systems of linear differential equations
- One parameter group of transformations, etc etc etc
