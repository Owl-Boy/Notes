# Undecidability of the Membership Problem
Just like the Halting Problem, the Membership Problem is also undecidable, this can be shown by [[Reduction|reducing]] the Halting Problem to the Memebership Problem, which means that if we have an instance of the Halting Problem, we can convert it to a Membership Problem, Hence if we have a general solution to the membership problem, then we have a general solution to the Halting Problem.
But the Halting Problem does not have a general solution. So Membership problem doesn't either.

Let $M$ be a turing Machine and we want to figure out wether $M$ halts on the input $x$. We construct a new Turing Machine $N$ that will accept a work if $M$ accepts or rejects it, we can do this by making the accept and reject state both go to a new accept it. Now the Halting problem for $M$ has become the membership problem for $N$. Hence any Halting Problem can be converted to membership problem, thus there is no general solution for the Halting Problem.
