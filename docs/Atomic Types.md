# Atomic Types
A term of an atomic type is reducible iff it is strongly normalizable so every term must satisfy the following conditions
- [[Reducibility#^CR1|CR1]] is a Tautology 
- [[Reducibility#^CR2|CR2]] If $t$ is strongly normalizable then every term $t'$  which reduces $t$ to is also strongly normalizable.
- [[Reducibility#^CR3|CR3]] A reduction path leaving $t$ must be through one of the $t'$, which are all strongly normalizable, and so if finite, and $v(t)$ is maximum of $v(t')+1$ where $t'$ vary over one step conversions from $t$
