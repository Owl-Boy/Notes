# Homeomorphisms
Homeomorphisms are a particular nice class of **continuous** functions that provide a way of detecting wether two topological spaces are the ==Same==. We say that $f$ is a **Homeomorphism** if it is continuous and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also continuous.
In this case, we say $(X,\mathcal T_X)\cong(Y,\mathcal T_Y)$ or simply $X\cong Y$.

Let $(X,\mathcal T_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal T_Y)$ be two topological spaces and $f:X\to Y$ be a bijective function between them, then the follwing are equivalent:
- $f$ is homeomorphic
- $f$ is open and contiuous
- $f$ is closed and contiuous
- $U\subseteq X$ is open if and only if $f(U)\subseteq Y$ is open

Properties of topological spaces which are preserved under homeomorphisms are called [[Topological Invariants]].
