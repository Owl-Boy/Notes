title: Ordinary Differential Equation
An _ordinary differential equation_ is a relation containing one independent variable $x\in\mathbb R$ and one dependent variable $y$, and some of its derivative $y',y'',\dots, y^{(n)}$
```

__Example__: $x^2y'' -3xy' + 3y = 0$ 

The _Order_ of an ODE is defined to be the order of the highest derivative in the equation, hence the above example is a second order ODE.

A function between the independent and the dependent variable which satisfies a differential equation is called the [[Solution of a differential equation|Solution]] of the differential equation.

A differential equation is said to be linear if it is linear in $y$ and its derivative. i.e an $n^{th}$-degree DE can be written as
$$
\mathcal P_n[y] = p_0(x)y+ p_1(x)y'+\dots+p_n(x)y^{(n)}=r(x)
$$
linear differential equation is said to be _Homogeneous_ if $r(x)=0$ otherwise its called _Nonhomogeneous_.
