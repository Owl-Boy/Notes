# Arc-Transitivity of a Graph
An $s$-arc is a sequence $v_{0}v_{1}\dots v_{s-1}v_{s}$ such that $v_{i}\sim v_{i+1}$

Let $\Gamma$ be an [[Automorphism Group of a Graph|Automorphism Group]] of $G$ such that $\Gamma$ is $s$-transitive $\forall$ s-arcs
$\alpha,\beta\in G\exists g\in\Gamma$ such that $g(\alpha)=\beta$
