# Dirichlet Kernels

```ad-note
### Definition:
The trigonometric polynomial defined on $[-\pi,\pi]$ by 
$$D_N(x) = \sum\limits_{-N}^{N} e^{inx}$$
is called the $N$-th dirichlet kernel.
```

- A closed form is given by $$D_N(x) = \dfrac{sin((N+1/2)x)}{sin(x/2)}$$
- $$\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int\limits_{-\pi}^{\pi}D_N(t)dt = 1$$
