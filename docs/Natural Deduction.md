# Natural Deduction
Natural Deductions (denoted by $\text{NJ}(\to,\land,\lor,\perp)$) is a simpler syntax for Intuitionistic logic. Natural deduction uses "Judgments" to prove statements

```ad-info
title:Judgements
Judgements are statements of the form
$$
\Gamma\vdash\phi
$$
Where $Gamma$ is a set of assumptions, $phi$ is the statement we need to prove.
The above statement can be read as 
$$
\text{$\Gamma$ proves $\phi$}
$$
```

Natural deductions has the following rules
It has mainly two types of rules
- Rules that Introduce an operator (Labelled with $I$)
- Rules that use, or eliminate an operator (Labelled with $E$)

The following are the rules for *natural deductions* in [[Intuitionistic Logic]].
