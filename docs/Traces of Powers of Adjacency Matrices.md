# Traces of Powers of Adjacency Matrices
The traces of powers of Adjacency Matrices denote the number of closed paths of a given length

like $\text{trace}(A^{n})$ would be the number of all closed paths of length $n$.

and trace of square and cube have a natural understanding 
$\text{trace}(A^{2})$ is the total number of edges in the graph.
$\text{trace}(A^{3})$ is the total number of triangles in the graph.

Also given the characteristic polynomial of the form $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}x^{i}$ 
then $c_{i}=(-1)^{i}\frac{\text{trace}(A^{i})}{i}$
