# Open and Closed Functions

```ad-note
title:
A function $f$ is called open when $U\in\mathcal T_{X}\implies f(U)\in\mathcal T_{Y}$
```
```ad-note
title:
A function $f$ is called closed when $U$ is closed $\implies f(U)$ is closed.
```
These functions are often confused with continuous function by those who are new to the fied.

A function is **Open** when it maps _open_ sets to _open_ sets and a function is **Continuous** when inverse images of _open_ sets are _open_

Neither are **Open** functions the same as **Closed functions**
- Constant functions of the type $\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ with standard topology are _continouous_ and _closed_ but not _open_
- projection functions from $\mathbb R^{2}\to \mathbb R$ withs standard topologies are _continuous_ adn _open_ but not _closed_.

1) Show that the projection maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ are open but not closed. 
	$A_n$ := $[1/n,1-1/n] \times \{n\}$, the union of these sets project onto $(0,1)$. Hence this map is not closed.
