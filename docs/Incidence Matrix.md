# Incidence Matrix

The incidence matrix of a graph $G=\langle V, E\rangle$ is a matrix $M$ of order $|V|\times|E|$ such that if the edge $m$ is incident on the vertex $n$ then $M_{n, m}$ is $1$ otherwise $0$. 

Nice Properties of incidence matrices.
$MM^{t}=\text{diag}(d_{1}, \dots,d_{n})+L(G)$
$M^{t}M=2I+G$
