# Two Stacks
A two stack machine is a machine with a two-way, read only input head, it is as powerful as a turing machine.
A turing  machine can be simulated by adding the elments to the left and right of the head to diffent stacks, the closest elments to the head being at the top, and moving the head would be the same as popping and element off a stack and pushing it onto another.
