 Take $f(z) = z ^{7}-2 z^{5}+6z^{3}-z+1$ and $g(z) = 6z^{3}$, then $|f(z)-g(z)| = |z ^{7}- 2 z ^{5} -z +1| \le |z| ^{7} + 2|z|^{5}+|z|+1 = 5 < 6 = |6z^{3}| = |g(z)|$ on $|z| = 1$.
 Hence, $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have the same number of roots inside $|z| = 1$ by Rouche's theorem, and $g(z)$ has 3 roots in that region, hence $f(z)$ has three roots in that region.

 Take $f(z) = z ^{4}-6z+3$ and $g(z) = -6z$, then $|f(z)-g(z)| = |z ^{4}+3| \le 4 < 6 = |g(z)|$ on $|z|=1$.
 Hence, $g$ and $f$ have same number of roots inside $|z| = 1$ by rouche's. Hence $f$ has 1 root inside $|z|=1$.
 
 We can see that there are no roots of $f$ on the circle $|z| = 1$, by taking $f$ and $g$ same as above and looking at the circle $|z| = 1 + \epsilon$ for small $\epsilon > 0$, since the inequalities above will not change with small change with small change in $\epsilon$.
 
 Now take $f(z) = z ^{4}- 6z+3$ and $g(z) = z ^{4}$, then $|f(z)-g(z)| = |-6z+3| \le 6|z|+3 = 15 < 16 = |z ^{4}| = |g(z)|$ on $|z| = 2$. Hence $f,g$ have same number of roots inside $|z|=2$, $g$ has 4 roots inside $|z|=2$, hence $f$ does too.
 
 So, there are $4-1 = 3$ roots of $f$ between $|z| = 2$ and $|z|=1$.
