# Distance of a Code
The Distance of a code is the [[Hamming Distance|distance]] between 2 codes.

## Theorem:
Given a code $C$, The following are equiavlent
1. $C$ has minimum distance $d\ge 2$
2. If $d$ is odd, $C$ can correct $\frac{d-1}{2}$ errors, if even then it can correct $\frac{d}{2}$-1 errors
3. It can detect $d-1$ erasures
