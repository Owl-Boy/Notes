# Order Topology
### Linear order 
```ad-note
title: 
A binary relation $<$ on a set A is a called a linear order if 
1. For every x,y in A x < y or x > y.
2. $x \nless x$ for all x in A.
3. x < y, y<z implies x<z.
```


### Lemma:
The open rays $(a,\infty)$ and $(-\infty,b)$ form a [[Sub-basis]].

The topo generated by this sub-basis is called the order topology.

#### Note: Subspace of order topology need not be the same as the order topology on the subspace.
Example: X = real numbers Y = $[0,1) \cup \{2\}$. In subspace topo of Y, $\{2\}$ is open but not in order topo.

### Theorem:
```ad-note
Let X be a linearly ordered set with $\tau_X$ order topo, $Y$ be a convex subset of X. Then order topo on Y is the same as the subspace topo on Y.
```
#### Proof:
