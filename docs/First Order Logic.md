# First Order Logic
```ad-tip
title: Motivation
Consider the typical structures in Maths and CS. Groups, Rings, Monoids etc etc. All of them are sets, equipped with _functions_ and _relations_ on them and sometimes they have _special promoted terms_, like units in groups.

**First Order Logic** gives a natural frameword to talk about these thingies.
The idea is to fix symbols to denote functions, relations and constants and combine the with the standard $\lnot$ and $\lor$ operator. In addtion to all that we have operators to quantify over all elements $\exists$ and $\forall$, and a $\equiv$ operator to check equality of primitive constructs.
```

The [[Syntax of First Order Logic|syntax]] and [[Semantics of First Order Logic|semantics]] are a bit more involved for first order logic, than in _Propositional Logic_.

*Groups* are a really good example to get introduced to first order logic

```ad-success
title:Goal
The goal of first order logic is to capture the properties of mathematical structures.
