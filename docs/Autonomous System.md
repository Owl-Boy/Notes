# Autonomous System
$\overline x = \overline v(t, \overline x)$ is dependent on $t$, hence it is called a **Non Autonomous** system whereas the equation $\overline x = \overline v(\overline x)$ is independent of $t$, hence it is called an **Autonomous** system.

Every **Non Autonomous** system can be converted into an **Autonomous** System in the following way 
$$
\begin{aligned}
{\partial x \over \partial t} &= t\\
{\partial x\over \partial u} &= y \text{ and } {\partial y\over \partial u}=1
\end{aligned}
$$
