title: Motivation Behind Ring Theory
Ring Theory was created to number theory of a set that is larger than number, for example take the questions :
Find integer solution of $x^2+y^2 = z^2$, This is a very tedious problem but instead if we do this.
$(x - yi)(x + yi) = z^2$ this now becomes a factorization problem in $\mathbb Z[i]$
Similarly $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ becomes $(x+y)(x+\omega y)(x+\omega^2y)=z^3$ in $\mathbb Z[\omega]$
```

A the set $(S, *, +)$ Where $S$ is a set and $*, +: (S, S) \to S$ such that $S$ is an abelian group under $+$ and its closed under $*$, Such that $*$ is distributive over $+$.

A [[Ring Homomorphism]] $\phi:R\to S$ , where $S$ and $R$ are rings and 
- $\phi(a+b) = \phi(a) + \phi(b)$
- $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$
$\aleph$
