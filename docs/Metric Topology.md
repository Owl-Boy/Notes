## Metric 
```ad-note
title: 
A _metric_ $d$ on a set $X$ is a function $d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ such that:
1) $d(x,y) \ge 0 \ \forall \ x,y \in X$ with equality iff $x = y$.
2) $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
3) $d(x,y) + d(y,z) \ge d(z,x)$ $\forall \ x,y,z \in X$. 
```

## Metric Topology
```ad-note:
title: 
Given a metric space $(X,d)$, the _metric topology_ $\tau_d$ on X is the topology generated by $\mathcal{B} = \{B_{\epsilon}(x) : \epsilon>0, x\in X\}$

```

#### note: $(X,d)$ is not the same object as $(X,\tau_d)$. 

## Metrisable space
```ad-note
title: 
A topological space is called _metrisable_ if $\tau = \tau_d$ for some metric $d$ on $X$.
```
---

## Proposition
```ad-note
title:
(X,d) is a metric space. Let
$$\overline{d} : X\times X \to \mathbb{R}$$
$$\overline{d}(x,y) = \mathrm{min}(d(x,y),1)$$
Then $\tau_d$ = $\tau_{\overline{d}}$
```
#### Proof:
Easy to see that $\overline{d}$ is a metric.
$B_{\epsilon,d}(x) = B_{\epsilon,\overline{d}}(x)$ for $\epsilon < 1$.
Hence is a set is open in $\tau_d$, it is open in $\tau_{\overline{d}}$, and vice versa. Hence both are the same topology.

#### This also shows that boundedness is not a topological property.

## Lemma:
```ad-note
title:
Let d,d' be metrics on X. Then $\tau_{d'}$ is finer than $\tau_d$ iff $\forall \ x, \ \forall \ \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta>0$ such that $B_{\delta,d'}(x) \subset B_{\epsilon,d}(x)$.
```

## Proposition:
```ad-note
title:
The Topologies induced on $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the euclidean metric (d) and the square metric ($\rho$) are the same, which are infact the same as the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
```
#### Proof:
Use the fact that $\rho(x,y) \le d(x,y) \le \sqrt{n}\rho(x,y)$, and show that $\tau_d = \tau_{\rho}$. 
Next show for that any basis element of the product topology and a point $x$ in it,  the basis element contains a basis element of the square topology containing $x$ and vice versa. $\square$

## Uniform metric (_Metric on an arbitrary product space_) 
```ad-note
title:
Given an index set J and given points $\textbf{x} = (x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in J}$ and $\textbf{y} = (y_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in J}$ on $\mathbb{R}^J$ by the equation:
$$\overline{\rho}(\textbf{x},\textbf{y}) = \sup \{\overline{d}(x_{\alpha},y_{\alpha}) | \alpha\in J\}$$
It is easy to check that $\overline{\rho}$ is a metric, this is called the uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^J$ and the topology induced by it is called the uniform topology.
```

## Theorem:
```ad-note
title:
The uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^J$ is finer than the product topology and coarser than the box topology; these three are all different if $J$ is infinite.
```
#### Proof: 
Given a basis element of the product toplogy, $U := \prod_{\alpha}U_{\alpha}$, where $U_{\alpha_i} \neq \mathbb{R}$ for $i = 1,2,\cdots,n$. For a point x in U, we can find $\epsilon_i$ such that $(x_i-\epsilon_i,x_i+\epsilon_i) \subset U_{\alpha_i}$. Let $\epsilon = \min_i{\epsilon_i}$. Then $B_{\bar\rho,\epsilon}(x) \subset U$. Hence uniform topo finer than product.

Now given a basis element of the uniform topo $B_{\bar\rho,\epsilon}(x)$, we have  $\prod_{\alpha} (x_{\alpha} - \epsilon/2,x_{\alpha} + \epsilon/2) \subset B_{\bar\rho,\epsilon}(x)$. 

##### HENCE: Product topology $\subseteq$ uniform topology $\subseteq$ box topology

If $J$ is infinite, we already know that box topology and product topology are different. 
Take the set $\prod_{\alpha} U_{\alpha}$ where $U_{\alpha_i} = (-1/i,1/i)$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and the rest are $\mathbb{R}$. 
This is not open in the uniform topology.

$\prod_{\alpha}(-\epsilon,\epsilon)$ is open in uniform topology but not in product topology (does not contain a basis element of product topology).

---

## Theorem:
```ad-note
title:
The only one of these cases where $\mathbb{R}^J$ is metrizable with $J$ infinite, is the case where $J$ is countable and $\mathbb{R}^J$ has the product topology.
```

#### Proof:
TO DO
