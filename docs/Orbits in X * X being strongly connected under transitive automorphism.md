#  Orbits in $X\times X$ being strongly connected under transitive automorphism
---
### Lemma:
Let $\Omega$ be a non-diagonal orbit in $X\times X$(under the action of transitive $(\Gamma, X)$) . The $\Omega$ is strongly connected iff it is weakly connected.

###  Proof:
Since $\Gamma$ is transitive, for all $x, z$ in $X$, we have that the 
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{in}(x)&= \text{in}(z)\\
\text{out}(x)&= \text{out}(z)\\
\end{align*}
$$
Let $\Omega$ be weakly connected.
let $S$ be a strong component such that $S$ is a sink.

Clearly for all $x\ne y$ and $\vec {xy}$ is an edge in $\Omega$ then:
Given any $v\in\Omega$, let $k_1=\text{in}(v)$ and $k_2=\text{out}(v)$ and $k_{1}= k_{2}$.

Let $S$ be a weak component of $\Omega$ then every edge in $S$ has** the property that the edge contributes $1$ each to out degree sum and in degree sum.
