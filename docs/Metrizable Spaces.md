# Metrizable Spaces
```ad-note
title:
A topo space that can be endowed with a metric inducing the same topology is called _metrizable_.
```

# Related Results
1) Metrizable $\implies$ Normal
2) Metrizable + separable $\implies$ 2nd countable
3) Metrizable + Lindelof $\implies$ 2nd countable
4) $\mathbb{R}^{J}$ with $J$ uncountable is **NOT** metrizable
5) $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ in the box topo is **NOT** metrizable. (For proof, refer to [[R^w]])

# Examples
1) $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ with the product topology is metrizable. (Look at [[R^w]])
