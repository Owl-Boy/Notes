# Local Path Connectedness
```ad-note
title:
X is _locally path connected_ at $x \in X$, if for every nbhd U of x, there is a path connected nbhd $V$ of x s.t. $x \in V \subset U$. 
```

```ad-note
title: Proposition
X is locally path connected iff for every open set U of X, each path connected component of U is open in X.
```

#### Proof:
If $X$ is LPC, then take an open set $U$, and an element $x$ in $U$, then there is a path connected nbhd $V$ of x contained in $U$, and so if $P_x$ denotes the path connected component of $x, V$ is contained in $P_x$. And so each path connected component of $U$ is open in $X$. 

Conversely, for any nbhd $U$ of $x$, there is a path component of $U$ that contains $x$, take this to be $V$. $\square$
