# Phase Space
A **Phase Space** is the space of all possible states of a given system. Its **Dimension** is determined by the number of parameter that the space is dependent on. And it is useful to capture the idea of Determinism, Finite Dimentionality, and Differentiability of processes formally.

For example Consider two cities joined by two roads, and 2 cars are moving of different roads in different directions simultaneously, then the phase space of the given system can be the following square

We can infer from this that no matter how the cars move, there will come a point where the cars will cross each other.

This examples is not related to differential equations but the course of reasoning is on the right track.
For example, the state of the processes in classical mechanics consisting of motion of $n$ points can be described by a system of $6n$ parameters which are $3$ parameter for position and $3$ for velocity for each point. A system of $n$ rigid bodies can be described by a phase space of $12n$ dimensions.

The motion of the entire system is described by the motion of a point in the phase space. The velocity of the the point in the phase space is defined by the point itself. So each point can be assigned a vector which is called the **Phase Velocity Vector**. and the set of all phase velocity vector is called the **Phase Velocity Vector Field**. This field described the differential equation.

The concept of phase space reduces the study of evolutionalry process to geometric process of finding a curve defined by a vector field.
