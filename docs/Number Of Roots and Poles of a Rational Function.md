#  Number Of Roots and Poles of a Rational Function
---
 ### Question:
From the above, show that the number of zeroes (with order) of $R(z)$ including those at $\infty$ is $\max(m,n)$, also show that the number of poles (with order) = $\max(m,n) = p$. The number $p$ is called the **order** of the rational function.
###  Answer:
First let $n>m$ then, the set of zeroes of $R$ = set of zeroes of numerator of $R$, which has size $n$. 
Also since $n>m$, $R$ does not have roots at $\infty$. Number of poles of $R$ = number of zeroes of denominator + $n-m = m + n-m = n$.

Similarly handle the case of $m>n$.
