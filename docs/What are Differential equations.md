# What are Differential equations
```ad-info
title:
In this course we will be dealing with ordinary differential equations.
```

An **ODE** is a functions of the form 
$$
\phi\left(x, y, y', y'', y^{(3)}\dots y^{(n)}\right) = 0
$$
where $y^{(n)}$ is the $nth$ derivative of $y$

Given an **ODE** we would want to find out the following-
1. Existence of solution, if there exists a function that satisfies $\phi$
2. If there exists a solution, then is it unique (given an initial condition as constants are in the kernel of the differential operator)
3. Can you solve it $\longleftrightarrow$ does there exits an exact form. [[Solution of a differential equation]]
