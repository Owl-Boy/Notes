# Solving a linear differential equations

$$
\phi\left(x, y, y'\dots y^{(n)}\right)
$$
And
$$
y^{(n)} = \Psi\left(x, y, y' \dots y^{(n-1)}\right)
$$
## First Order Differential Equations

#### Case 1 $y'=g(x)$
By Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: $g(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and
$(a, c)\to f(x) = c+\int\limits_a^xg(t)dt$
#### Case 2
###### A] Homogenous $y'=-p(x)y$

#### Case
