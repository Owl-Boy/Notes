# Characterisic of a field
The _Characteristic_ of a field $F$, denoted $\text{ch}(F)$ is the smallest positive integer $p$ such that $p\cdot1_F=0$, if such $p$ exists, otherwise its defined to be $0$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
n\times1_F+m\times1_F &= (n+m)\times1_F\\
(n\times1_F)\cdot(m\times1_F) &= mn\cdot1_F 
\end{aligned}
$$
from this we get that $\text{ch}(F)$ is either a prime $p$ or $0$. Also, $p\cdot\alpha = 0\forall\alpha\in F$

If we define $(-n)\cdot1_F=-(n\cdot1_F)$, we can define a homomorphism $\phi:\mathbb Z\to F$ such that $n\mapsto n\cdot1_F$
such that $\ker(\phi) = \text{ch}(F)\mathbb Z$ 
Since $F$ is a field, $F$ contains a subfield that is either isomorphic to $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb Q$ which in either case is the smallest subfield containing $1_F$.

A _Prime Subfield_ of a field $F$ is the subfield generated by the element $1_F$ of $F$. It is isomorphic to either $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ where $p\ne0$ is $\text{ch}(F)$ or $\mathbb Q$ if $\text{ch}(F) = 0$.
