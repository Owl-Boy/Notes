# Intermediate Value Theorem
```ad-note
title:
For any continuous function $f$ on an interval $[a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$, and any $r$ such that $f(a) < r < f(b)$, then there exists $c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) = r$.
```

#### Note: this generalises to connected topological spaces. (See references)
