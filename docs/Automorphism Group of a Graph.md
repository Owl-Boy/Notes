# Automorphism Group of a Graph
The Automorphism Group of a graph is the Group of Automorphisms that can be applied on a graph with the group operation being composition.

For example, the Automorphism of a graph $C_{4}$ is $D_{4}$

Graphs that have a trivial Automorphism group are called _asymmetric_, and if they have a non trivial Automorphism group, they are called _symmetric_

let $\sigma\in S_n$ be the action on the set of vertices, then $\sigma'$ denotes the action of the same automorphism on the edges. (It's a bijection on the powerset of edges)

Let $\sigma'$ have $t$ orbits on $E[n]$, then $\sigma'$ has $2^{t}$ fixed points on $\mathcal PE[n]$  
Let $\text{orb}(\sigma')$ be the number of orbits of $\sigma'$ on $E[n]$
