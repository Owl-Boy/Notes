# Exponential Generating Functions
**Exponential Generating Functions** are a type of [[Generating Functions]] that are of the form 
$$
F(x) = \sum\limits_{n\ge0} \frac{f(n)x^{n}}{n!}
$$
where $f(n)$ is the Generating Functions.
These functions can generally be written in a closed from that is in the form of an exponential, hence given the name.
