# Regular Permutation Groups
Let $(\Gamma, X)$ be a permutation group. $\Gamma$ is said to be **Semiregular** on $X$ if $\forall x\in X,\Gamma_{x}=\{1\}$. Which is to say that the only permutation that has an fixed point is the identity permutation. 
If $\Gamma$ is also [[T-Transitiviy of Graphs|transitive]], then it is called regular.

In spirit, regular permutation groups mimic cycles. 

The most common example of **Regular** permutation groups are  cycles
