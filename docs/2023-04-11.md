### Theorem 1:
```ad-note
title:
Suppose that $X = U \cup V$ is covered by two open, simply connected subspaces $U$ and $V$. Further assume that their intersection is path connected. Then $X$ is simply connected.
```

### Theorem 2:
```ad-note
title:
Suppose that $X = U \cup V$ is a union of two open path connected subspaces of $X$. Suppose $U \cap V$ is path connected.
Fix $x_0 \in U \cap V$. Let $i : U \hookrightarrow X$ and $j : V \hookrightarrow X$ then the images of the induced homomorphisms $i_*$ and $j_*$ generate $\Pi_1(X,x_0)$ as a group.
```

#### NOTE: Theorem 1 follows from theorem 2.

- The theorem says that: Given any loop $f$, in $X$, based at $x_{0}$ it is path homotopic to a product of the form $(g_{1}*(g_{2}*(g_{3}*(\dots g_{n})))$, where each $g_{i}$ is a loop in $X$ based at $x_{0}$, that lies in either $U$ or $V$ (or both).

##### Proof:
Note that $X$ is path connected.
We show that there is a finite subdivision $a_{0} < a_{1} < \dots < a_{n}$ of $[0,1]$ s.t. $f(a_{i}) \in U \cap V$  and $f([a_{i},a_{i+1}]) \subseteq U$ or $V$ or both.
- For this, choose a subdivision $b_{0}<b_{1}<\dots<b_{m}$ of $[0,1]$ s.t. for each $i$, the set $f([b_{i-1},b_{i}])$ is contained in either $U$ or $V$.
- This is possible because $f ^{-1}(U)$ and $f ^{-1}(V)$ cover $[0,1]$. So by lebesgue number lemma, there is a partition $b_{0} < b_{1} < \dots < b_{m}$ s.t. each $[b_{j-1},b_{j}]$ is contained in either $f ^{-1}(U)$ or $f ^{-1}(V)$ (or both).
- If $f(b_{i}) \in U \cap V$ for all $i$, then done. Otherwise, let $i$ be an index s.t. $f(b_{i}) \notin U \cap V$. 
- $f([b_{i-1},b_{i}])$ and $f([b_{i},b_{i+1}])$ lie in either $U$ or $V$. WLOG, $f(b_{i}) \in U$ and so $f([b_{i-1},b_{i}])$ and $f([b_{i},b_{i+1}])$ both lie in $U$. So we can just delete $b_{i}$. 
- Then the new subdivision still has the same property.

Given this subdivision, define $f_{i}$ to be the path $$
[0,1] \xrightarrow{} [a_{i-1},a_{i}]\xrightarrow{f}X
$$
By construction, $[f] = [f_{1}]*[f_{2}]*\dots*[f_{n}]$. Since $U \cap V$ is path connected choose a path $\alpha_{i} \subseteq U \cap V$ from $x_{0}$ to $f(a_{i})$. 
Then define $g_{i} := \alpha_{i-1} * f*\bar{\alpha_{i}}$
So, $[f] = [g_{1}]*[g_{2}]*\dots*[g_{n}]$, which is what was desired.

### Theorem 3:
```ad-note
title:
$\Pi_1(S_n) \cong \{1\}$ for $n \ge 2$.
```
##### Proof:
- Let $N = (0,0,\dots,0,1)$ and $S = (0,0,\dots,0,-1)$ be the north and south pole of $S ^{n}$ respectively.
- Let $U = S ^{n}\setminus \{ S \}$ and $V = S ^{n}\setminus \{ N \}$
- $h : U \to \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $h(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n+1}) = \frac{1}{1+x_{n+1}}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})$
- Similarly, $V \cong \mathbb{R} ^{n}$ and $U \cap V \cong \mathbb{R} ^{n} \setminus\{ 0 \}$ path connected.
- Then $\Pi_{1}(S_{n})$ is generated by $i_{*}(\Pi_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n}))$ and $j_{*}(\Pi_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})) \implies \Pi_{1}(S ^{n}) \cong \{ 1 \}$.

### Theorem 4:
```ad-note
title:
$\Pi_1(\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2$
```
##### Proof:
- $p : S ^{n} \to \mathbb{RP}^{n}$ is a covering map, given by identifying each point $x$ to $-x$.
- This is an open map.
- $S ^{n}$ is simply connected. 
- This implies, $\Pi_{1}(\mathbb{RP}^{n},y) \xrightarrow{bijection}p ^{-1}(y)$.
- So $\Pi_{1}(\mathbb{RP}^{n},y)$ has only two elements, hence is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2$.

### Example:
Let $X$ be the figure 8 space.
Let $U$ and $V$ be the subspaces of $X$ that deformation retract to $S ^{1}$. $U \cap V$ is path connected.
$\implies \Pi_{1}(X)$ is generated by the images of two maps from $\Pi_{1}(S ^{1})\cong \mathbb{Z}$, say generators are $[a],[b]$.
So every element of $\Pi_{1}(X)$ is written as $$
[a]^{n_{1}}*[b] ^{n_{2}}*\dots
$$
- The following is a covering space of the figure 8: 
  Take the axes $x,y$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ attach a loop at each lattice point in the union of these axes.
  This can be used to show that $[a]*[b] \neq [b]*[a]$
