# Burnside's Lemma
```ad-note
title:
Number of orbits = $\frac{1}{|G|}\sum\limits_{r}fix(r)$
```
where $fix(r)$ is the number of elements fixed by $r$

This can also be thought as the size of the automorphism class.

The possible sizes of autmorphism classes are 
$\frac{n!}{i}$ where $i$ can be a natural number.
