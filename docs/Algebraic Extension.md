# Algebraic Extension

$\alpha \in K$ is said to be _algebraic_ over $F$ if it is the root of some non-zero polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$. If not, $\alpha$ is called _Transcendental_ over $F$. If $\forall\alpha\in K$ is algebraic over $F$, $K$ is called an [[Algebraic Extension]] of $F$. 

```ad-note
If $\alpha$ is algebraic over some field $F$ then it is algebraic over all field extensions $L$ of $F$.
```

_Proposition:_ Let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $F$, then there exists a unique irreducible monic polynomial $m_{\alpha, F}(x)\in F(x)$ which has $\alpha$ as its root. Any $f(x)$ has $\alpha$ as a root iff $m_{\alpha, F}(x) \nmid f(x)$   
_Proof:_ Let $g(x)$ be the polynomial of least degree with $\alpha$ as its root. $g(x)$ cannot be written as $a(x)\cdot b(x)$ where $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are polynomials of smaller degrees, becuase that would imply $\alpha$ is a root of either $a(x)$ or $b(x)$, which contradicts the minimality of $g(x)$. Suppose there exits another monic polynomial $f(x)$ which is irreducible and $\alpha$ is its root. Then using the euclidian algorithm, we can find 
$$
f(x) = q(x)\cdot g(x) + r(x)
$$
which implies $\alpha$ is a root of $r(x)$ which has degree less than $g(x)$ which also contradicts the minimality of $g(x)$, Hence it is unique.

_Proposition:_ If $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ and $F(\alpha)$ is the field generated by $\alpha$ over $F$ then 
$$
F(\alpha)\cong F[x]/\big(m_{\alpha}(x)\big)
$$
and 
$$
[F(\alpha):F]=\deg m_\alpha(x) = \deg \alpha
$$
i.e the degree of $\alpha$ over $F$ is the degree of the [[Extension Field |extension]] it generates over $F$ 

_Proposition:_ If $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ and $F(\alpha)$ is the smallest field extension of $F$ containing $\alpha$,then $[F(\alpha):F]$ will be finite
_Proof:_ Let $[F(\alpha):F] = n$, take the $n+1$ elements 
$$
1, \alpha, \alpha^2\dots \alpha^n
$$
of $F(\alpha)$ are linearly dependent.
Then
$$
b_0 + b_1\alpha+\dots+ b_n\alpha^n = 0
$$
for not all $b_i=0$, hence, there exits a polynomial of degree atmost $n$ such that $\alpha$ is a root of it.

This implies 
_Proposition:_ If the extension $K/F$ is finite, then it is algebraic.
and
_Theorem:_ The extension $K/F$ is finite $\iff$ $K$ is generated by a finite number of algebraic elements over $F$. More precisely, a field generated by algebraic elements of degrees $n_1,n_2, n_3\dots n_k$ is algebraic of degree $<n_1n_2n_3\dots n_k$  
_Corollary:_ if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are algebraic over $F$, then $\alpha \pm \beta, \alpha\beta,\frac\alpha\beta$ are also algebraic over $F$.
