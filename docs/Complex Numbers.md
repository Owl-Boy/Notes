# Complex Numbers
$$
\mathbb C=\frac {\mathbb{R}[x]}{(1+x^2)}
$$
where $\mathbb C$ is the [[Fields|field]] of **Complex Numbers**, and is a [[Extension Field|field extension]] of **Real Numbers**, and the basis for it are written as $\{1, \iota\}$
Hence if $z\in \mathbb C,\exists a, b\in\mathbb R$ such that $! z=a+b\iota$
Also we have an automorphism $c: a+b\iota \mapsto a-b\iota$ which is called conjugation.

Since $\mathbb C$ is a $2$ dimensional vector space, it is isomorphic to $\mathbb R^2$
Hence we can pull back the euclidian norm of $\mathbb R^2$ onto $\mathbb C$.
This induces the norm $|a+bi| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$
