Can be identified with $\{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \ |z| = 1\}$

### Theorem:
```ad-note
title:
It has fundamental group = $\mathbb{Z}$.
```
##### Proof:
Need to show $\varphi([f]*[g]) = \varphi([f])*\varphi([g])$
Let $\widetilde{f}(1) = n, \widetilde{g}(1)=m$, $\widetilde{f}(0) = \widetilde{g}(0) = 0$
Define $h(s) := n + \widetilde{g}(s)$. This is a lift of $g$ starting at $n$. 
Then the path $f * \widetilde{h}$ is well defined on $\mathbb{R}$, with endpoints $0$ and $n+m$.
Thus it is the unique lifting of $f *g$ starting at $0$. This means $\varphi([f]*[g]) = m+n = \varphi([f])+\varphi([g])$

### Lemma 1:
```ad-note
title:
There is no retraction of $B^{2}$ to $S ^{1}$. Here, $B^{2}$ denotes the closed unit disk $\{ (x,y) \mid \ x ^{2}+y^{2} \le 1 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$.
```
##### Proof:
Look at [[Retractions]].

### Lemma 2:
```ad-note
title:
Let $h : S ^{1} \to X$ cts. Then the following are equivalent.

(1) $h$ is null homotopic.

(2) $h$ extends to a cts map $k: B ^{2} \to X$

(3) $h_{*} : \Pi_{1}(S ^{1}) \to \Pi_{1}(X)$ is the trivial homomorphism.
```
##### Proof:
(1) $\implies$ (2)
$H : S ^{1} \times I \to X$  - homotopy between $h$ and a constant map. 
Define $\Pi : S ^{1} \times I \to B ^{2}$, $\Pi(x,t) = (1-t)x$
Check that $\Pi$ is a quotient map.
$S ^{1} \times \{ 1 \}$ collapses to the point of origin.
Homeomorphism on $S ^{1} \times [0,1) \to B ^{2} \setminus \{ (0,0) \}$
Let $\sim$ denote the equivalence relation given by $\Pi \implies H$ is constant on the fibers
$\implies \phi : (S ^{1} \times I)/\sim \to X$, i.e, $\exists k:B ^{2} \to X$ s.t. $H = k \circ\Pi$
Since $\Pi$ maps $S ^{1} \times \{ 0 \}$ to $S ^{1} = \partial B ^{2}$.
$k |_{S ^{1}} = H|_{S ^{1} \times \{ 0 \}} = h$.

(2) $\implies$ (3)
If $h = k|_{S ^{1}}$ then $h = k \circ i$ where $i : S ^{1} \hookrightarrow B ^{2}$ is the inclusion map.
$h_{*} = k_{*}\circ i_{*}$, but $\Pi_{1}(B ^{2}) = 1$ then $k_{*}$ trivial $\implies h_{*}$ is trivial.

(3) $\implies$ (1) 
Take the map $$
I \xrightarrow{f} S ^{1} \xrightarrow{h}X
$$
Where $f$ is just $f(x) = (\cos 2\pi x,\sin 2\pi x)$, so $h_{*}([f]) = [e_{x_{0}}]$ since $h_{*}$ is trivial.
This means that $h \circ f \simeq_{p} e_{x_{0}}$ where $e_{x_{0}}$ just denotes the constant path at $x_{0}$.
This means there is a homotopy $H : I \times I \to X$ such that $H(x,0) = h \circ f (x)$ and $H(x,1) = x_{0}$.
Since $H$ takes equal value on $\{ 0 \} \times I$ and $\{ 1 \} \times I$, I can define $\widetilde{H} : S ^{1} \times I \to X$ with $H(x,0) = h \circ \widetilde{f}$ where $\widetilde{f}$ is just $f$ but on $S ^{1}$ which is actually just $id_{S ^{1}}$, and $H(x,1) = x_{0}$.
and so, $h \circ \widetilde{ f} \simeq_p x_{0}$ 
But notice that $\widetilde{f}$ is just $id_{S ^{1}}$.
And so, $h \simeq_{p} x_{0}$.

### Corollary 
```ad-note
title:
$f: S ^{1} \to \mathbb{R}^{2}\setminus \{ (0,0) \}$ is not null homotopic.
```
##### Proof:
$r(x) = \frac{x}{|x|}$ a retraction of $\mathbb{R}^{2}\setminus \{ (0,0) \}$ to $S ^{1}$.
$r \circ i = id_{S ^{1}} \implies r_{*} \circ i_{*} = id_{\Pi_{1}(S ^{1})}$
$\implies i_{*}$ is non trivial $\implies i$ is not null homotopic.

### Corollary
```ad-note
title:
$id: S ^{1} \to S ^{1}$ is not null homotopic
```
##### Proof:
$id_{*} = id:\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is non trivial.

### Theorem:
```ad-note
title:
If $h : S^1 \to S^1$ is continuous and antipode preserving, then $h$ is not null homotopic.
```
##### Proof:
We show that $h_{*} : \Pi_{1}(S ^{1}) \to \Pi_{1}(S ^{1})$ is a non trivial homomorphism.
Let $b_{0} = (1,0)$ and let $h(b_{0}) = a_{0}$.
If $a_{0} = b_{0}$, continue with original $h$, otherwise choose $r_{\theta}: S ^{1}\to S ^{1}$ s.t. $r_{\theta}(a_{0})=b_{0}$, redefine $h:= r_{\theta} \circ h$.

Consider $q : S ^{1} \to S ^{1}$, $q(z) = z ^{2}$.
$q$ is a closed, continuous surjection, in fact a covering map.

$\implies$ The inverse image of any point $w$ on $S ^{1}$ under $g$ consists of two antipodal points, $z$ and $-z$.
$\implies$ In particular, $q \circ h$ is a map that is constant on each of the preimages $q ^{-1}(w)$.

```tikz
\usepackage{tikz-cd} 
\begin{document} 
\begin{tikzcd}     
S^1    \arrow[r,"h"] \arrow[dr,"q \circ h"] \arrow[d,"q"] & S ^1\arrow[d,"q"] \\
S^1  \arrow[r,"k"] & S^1
\end{tikzcd}
\end{document}
```

$\implies$ This induces $k : S ^{1}\to S ^{1}$. $k \circ q = q\circ h$
$q(b_{0}) =  h(b_{0}) = b_{0} \implies k(b_{0}) = b_{0}$ as well, $k(-b_{0}) = -b_{0}$.

- To show $k_{*}: \Pi_{1}(S ^{1}) \to \Pi_{1}(S ^{1})$ is non trivial
- $q$ is a covering map. Note that if $\widetilde{f}$ is any path in $S ^{1}$, from $b_{0}$ to $-b_{0}$ then $f := q \circ \widetilde{f}$ is a loop that corresponds to a non trivial element in $\Pi_{1}(S ^{1}, b_{0})$. (end point != beginning point)
- Claim: $k_{*}([f])$ is non trivial
$k_{*}([f]) = [k \circ q\circ \widetilde{f}] = [q \circ h \circ \widetilde{f}]$
$h \circ \widetilde{f}$ is a path in $S ^{1}$ from $b_{0}$ to $-b_{0}$ so that $[q \circ (h\circ \widetilde{f})]$ is not trivial.

- $k_{*}$ is injective.
  Now $q: S ^{1} \to S ^{1}$ is a degree 2 cover. $q_{*} : \Pi_{1}(S ^{1}) \to \Pi_{1}(S ^{1})$ is multiplication by 2.
  $q_{*} \circ h_{*} = k_{*} \circ q_{*}$ is injective, hence $h_{*}$ is injective as well.
