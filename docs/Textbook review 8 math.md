# Textbook review 8 math

## Contents
- Squares and square roots and cubes and cube roots - why two different things?



- The prelims part is titled "Prilims"..... <u>***smh***</u>
- Reads like an undergrad book
	- Goes top down instead of building things up from bottom to top
- Intimidating because of fancy words (Closure)
	- When should such words be introduced, if at all? Definitely not used to introduce things, words can maybe be mentioned at the end of a section (by the way, this is called closure) and until kids are comfortable using only the word (which is expected to take a while), whenever the idea is referred to, refer to it both by name and by the idea itself
- How necessary is learning abstraction at the age of 13?
- Can the art be slightly more appealing
- Highlight that there is a revision / start with a revision, because if someone doesn't remember the terms / ideas that are being mentioned right at the start of the chapter, they might not get as far as the revision before getting discouraged [pg 15]
- Can linear equations be motivated again in class 8



## Ignore :)
- 'Rationalized' vs 'rationalization'
