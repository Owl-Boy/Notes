# Hausdorff Property
### Definiton
A Topological Space $X$ is called a **Hausdorff Space** if for each pair of points $x, y$ there exits a pair of open sets $U,V$ such that $x\in U, y\in V, U\cap V=\emptyset$ 

If a Topology is finer than a Hausdorff Topology then it is also a Housdorf Topology

# Examples
1) $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ with product topology is Hausdorff. (See [[R^w]])
2) Every metric space is Hausdorff.
