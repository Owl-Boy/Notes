# Closed sets
### Definition
```ad-note
title:
A subset A of a T.S. X is called closed if its complement in X is open.
```
1. $\phi$ and X are closed
2. finite union of closed sets is closed
3. arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed.

#### Note:
Y is a subspace of X and A is a subset of Y. A being closed in Y _does not_ imply A being closed in X.
example: Y = (2,3), X = $\mathbb{R}$, A = (2,2,5].

### Lemma
```ad-note
title:
Let Y be a subspace of X,A is a subset of Y. A is closed in Y iff it is the intersection of a closed set in X with Y.
```


### Lemma
```ad-note
title:
Let Y be a subspace of X. If A is closed in Y and Y is closed in X then A is closed in X.
