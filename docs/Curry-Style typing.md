# Curry-Style typing
Curry first introduced types for Combinatory Logic, and that formulation was later adopted to [[Lambda Calculus Syntax|Lambda Calculus]] 

In Curry's typing system, the terms are those of untyped lambda calculus, and the rules of typing selects valid terms if they are typable.

Since each term does not carry a type of itself, we need an environment to give types to terms. Then we use the typablility rules on those and the terms that can be typed are considered valid.

Given a denumerably infinite set of alphabet $U$ whose member are called type variable and the set of **simple types** is represented by the strings generated by the grammar:
$$
\begin{matrix}\Pi  & ::= & U & | & (\Pi\to\Pi)\end{matrix}
$$
And the lambda Terms themselves are generated by the grammar
$$
\begin{matrix}\Lambda & ::= & V & | & \lambda V.\Lambda & | & \Lambda\; \Lambda\end{matrix}
$$

Where $V$ is the set of variables.

Along with these, since typing is not built into the syntax of the terms, there is a **context** $C$ of variables and types

$$
\{x_{1}:\tau_{1},\dots,x_{n}:\tau_{n}\}
$$
where $x_{i}$ are the variables and $\tau_{i}\in \Pi$
Along with these, since typing is not built into the syntax of the 

We define the **domain** function for the context $\Gamma =  \{x_{1}:\tau_{1},\dots,x_{n}:\tau_{n}\}$ such that $\text{dom}(\Gamma)=\{x_{1},\dots,x_{n}\}$

We also define a **range** function for context $\Gamma =  \{x_{1}:\tau_{1},\dots,x_{n}:\tau_{n}\}$ such that $|\Gamma|=\{\tau_{1},\dots,\tau_{n}\}$

We use the following typability relation $\vdash$ on $C\times\Gamma\times\Pi$
![[Simply Typed Lambda Calculus Syntax#^f1c6a3]]

And the set $(\vdash, \Gamma,\Pi)$ is the calculus.

Examples:
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{I} &:= \lambda x.x &&:\sigma\to\sigma\\
\mathbf{K} &:= \lambda xy.x &&:\sigma\to\tau\to\sigma\\
\mathbf{S} &:= \lambda xyz.xz(yz) &&:(\sigma\to\tau\to\theta)\to(\sigma\to\tau)\to\sigma\to\theta
\end{align*}
