# NP Complexity Class
### NP
```ad-note
title:
Class of decision problems that can be verified in a [[Turing Machines|deterministic turing machine]] in polynomial time, or the the problems that can be decided by a non deterministic turing machine in polynomial time.
```
### Examples
- **SAT** - Given a boolean expressions is there an assignment of variables such that the expression evaluates to _TRUE_  
- **3-COLOUR**- Given a graph, is there a way to colour the vertices using three colours such that no two neighbouring vertices have the same colour
- **HAMILTONIAN**- Given a graph, does it contain a Hamiltonian path.

If **P $\ne$ NP**, then there are infinitely many complexity classes between **P** and [[NP Complete]]. Problems like Factoring and Graph Isomorphism are problems which are thought to be neither **NP Complete** nor **P**
