# Closure
### Definition
```ad-note
title:
Let $A \subset X$, then $Cl_X(A)$, closure of A in X, is the intersection of all closed sets of X containing A.
```

- Closure can't be empty unless A = $\phi$.
- We say that $A$ is **dense** in $X$ is $Cl_X(A) = X$.

### Definition
A topo X is called **separable** if it has a countable dense subset.

### Theorem
```ad-note
title:
X is a T.S., Y subspace of X, A subset of Y. Then $Cl_Y(A) = Cl_X(A) \cap Y$.
```

# Interior
### Definition
```ad-note
title:
Let $A \subset X$, then $Int_X(A)$, interior of A in X, is the union of all open sets of X contained in A.
```
- Int A can be empty.

#### Lemma:
1. $Int (X-A) = X - Cl(A)$
2. $X - Int(A) = Cl(X-A)$

### Theorem
```ad-note
title:
$x \in Cl(A) \iff$ every open nbhd of x intersects A.
```

# Limit Points
### Definition
```ad-note
title: Limit points
$x$ is a limit point of $A$ if every open nbhd of $x$ contains a point of $A$ other than $x$.

$A'$ := set of limit points of $A$.
```

### Theorem 
```ad-note
title:
$Cl(A) = A \cup A'$
```
