# Separation Axioms
### Motivation- Quirky Behaviour of Limits
Consider the topology $\{\emptyset, \{a\}, X\}$ on $X=\{a, b\}$ 
Here the smallest neighbourhood of $a$ is $\{a\}$, hence it a limit  point of the sequence $a,a,a,a,a\dots$ duh.

But the only open neighbourhood of $b$ is $\{a, b\}$, so $b$ is also a limit point of the sequence $a, a, a,a,a\dots$

To obtain unique limits for convergent sequences, we may assume that a topology is "fine enough" to separate points. Such additional hypothesis are called Separating axioms or **Trennungsaxiome (German)**

Some of them being:
- $T_0$ or Kolmogorov ![[Kolmogorov Property#Definiton]]
- $T_1$ or Frechet![[Frechet Property#Definition]]
- $T_2$ or Housdorff ![[Hausdorff Property#Definiton]]
