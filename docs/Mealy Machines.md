# Mealy Machines

```ad-quote
title: History - Sequential Circuits
Sequential Circuits are machines whose inputs depend not only on the current input but also the previous sequence of inputs received. 
D.A. Huffman was the first person to give a useful description of such model which would describe the machine like a *Flow Chart* which after some complicated procedures were reduced to a form with minimal storage elements (for the previous sequence of inptus).
Independently E.F. Moore worked on experiment that can infer the workings of such a machine only based on input output experiments from a terminal. His approach turned out to be idenitcal to  Huffman's description, i.e **Flow Chart Manipulation**.

Huffman's method didn't usually work in its unmodified form with the type of circuitry found in the digital computers, so Mealy extended Huffman's machines to make it more compatible with the computers.

The *Mealy Automata* are a simplified description of the circuits described my mealy that mainly focus of the "state" of the circuit.
