# Product topology
### Definition
```ad-note 
title:
$(X,\tau_X); (Y,\tau_Y)$. Then the product topology on the set $X \times Y$ is the topology generated by the basis $\mathcal{B}_{X\times Y} = \{U \times V; U \in \tau_X, V \in \tau_Y\}$ 
```
#### exercise: Check that this is a basis.

#### Lemma: 
$\mathcal{B}_{X\times Y} = \{B_1 \times B_2 : B_1 \in \mathcal{B}_X, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}_Y\}$ is a basis.

### Examples
1. Any finite product of discrete spaces is discrete.
2. $(\mathbb{R}_{std})^n =\mathbb{R}_{std}^n$

### Projections
Let $(X_i,\tau_i)$ be finitely many topo spaces with the kth projection map: 
$$\pi_k : \prod X_i \to X_i$$
$$\pi_k((x_i)) = x_k$$
#### Fact:
$A \subset X$, $B \subset Y$ then $\pi_1^{-1}(A) = A\times Y$ and $\pi_2^{-1}(B) = X \times B$. 

### Theorem 
```ad-note
title:
The collection $S_{X\times Y} = \{\pi_1^{-1}(U); U \in \tau_X\} \cup \{\pi_2^{-1}(V) : V \in \tau_Y\}$ is a [[Sub-basis]] for $\tau_{X\times Y}$.
```
#### Proof
Let $\tau$ be the topo gen by $S := S_{X\times Y}$.
Every element of S is in $\tau_{X \times Y}$ implies that $\tau \subset \tau_{X \times Y}$.
Every basis element $U \times V$ of $\tau_{X\times Y}$ is $\pi_1^{-1}(U) \cap \pi_2^{-1}(V) \subset \tau$
This gives that $\tau_{X\times Y} \subset \tau$. 

**This definition with the sub-basis generalises to more general settings.**

### Theorem 
```ad-note 
title: Product of subspace is same as subspace of product. 

If A is a subspace of X, B is a subspace of Y. Then $\tau_{A \times B}$ = subspace topo on $A\times B$ from $X \times Y$. 
```
#### proof:
$\mathcal{B}_{A\times B} = \{M \times N : M \in \tau_A, N \in \tau_B\} = \{(U \cap A) \times (V\cap B) : U \in \tau_X, V\in \tau_Y\} = \{(U\times V)\cap (A \times B)\} =$ basis for subspace topo on $A\times B$.

### Products and continuity

1) Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces and give $X \times Y$ the product topology. We have the two maps $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y$ . Then $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are continuous.
2) Let Z be any topological space. A function $f : Z \to X \times Y$ is continuous if and only if both of its components $f_1 = \pi_1 \circ f : Z \to X$ and $f_2 = \pi_2 \circ f : Z \to Y$ are continuous.
3) The product topology is the coarsest topology on $X \times Y$ such that both the projection maps are continuous.

```ad-info
title: Idea
There is a natural bijection between $\mathrm{Func}(X\times Y, Z)$ and $\mathrm{Func}(X, \mathrm{Func}(Y,Z))$. Here Func is the set of all set theoretic funtions between the two sets in consideration.
But such a thing does not happen if we consider continuous functions. 
- Suppose $f : X \times Y \to Z$ is a continuous function. Now for each $x$, we have $i_x : Y \to X \times Y$ which is just an inclusion $i_x(y) = (x,y)$. Now the map $H_f(x) := f \circ i_x : Y\to Z$ is a continuous map.
- So we get a map $\mathrm{Cont}(X \times Y,Z) \to \mathrm{Func}(X,\mathrm{Cont}(Y,Z))$. But this is not surjective since we can have functions $f$ that are continuous in one direction for all fixed $x$, but is not continuous. So to fix this we need to talk about continuity of $H_f$ but then we want a topology on $\mathrm{Cont}(Y,Z)$.
- We can think of $Func(Y,Z) = \prod\limits_{y \in Y} Z$, so we need to look at product topologies for arbitrary products. 
```

### Product topology on arbitrary products
```ad-note
title: 
The product topology on $\prod\limits_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$ is the topology generated by the sub-basis 
$$S = \{ \pi_{\beta}^{-1}(U_{\beta}): \beta \in J, U_{\beta} \text{ open in } X_{\beta}\}$$
```
- Note that this is the coarsest topology which makes all the projection maps continuous.

### Topology on function spaces
Given the space of functions $f : X \to Y$, for topo spaces X and Y, we can put a topology on Func(X,Y) which is the product space $\prod\limits_{x\in X} Y$, with the product topology as defined above.
Convergence of sequences in this topology is the same as **pointwise convergence**.

### Lemma
```ad-note
title:
Let $(f_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of functions $f_n : Y \to Z$ and let $f : Y \to Z$ be another such function. Then $f_n \to f$ as $n \to \infty$ in Func(Y, Z) if and only if the functions $f_n$ converge pointwise to f , i.e. if and only if for each y $\in$ Y , we have $f_n(y) \to f(y)$ as $n \to \infty$ in Z.
```

### Some properties of products:
1) Let $A_{\alpha}$ be a subspace of $X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$. Then the product topology on $\prod\limits_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}$ equals the subspace topology induced from $\prod_{\alpha}X_{\alpha}$.
2) If each $X_{\alpha}$ is hausdorff then the product is hausdorff.
3) If each $X_{\alpha}$ has at least two points and the product is hausdorff then each $X_{\alpha}$ is hausdorff.
4)  Let $A_{\alpha}$ be a subspace of $X_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha$. Then closure of the product of $A_{\alpha}$ is equal to the product of the closures.

# Related Problems
1) Show that $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$ is separable in the product topology.
   Proof:
   Look at each element in R^R as a graph in R^2, then partition the plane into a grid of resolution 1/n at the nth step and pick heights for the function in the first n^2 columns on each side of the origin. This gives a countable collection of functions which can be used to approximate any function in $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{R}$.
