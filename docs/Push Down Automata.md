# Push Down Automata

_Pushdown Automata_ (Accepting by final states)
$(Q,\Sigma, T, T_0, Q_0, \Delta,F)$
_Pushdown Automata_ (Accepting by empty stack)
$(Q,\Sigma, T, T_0, Q_0, \Delta)$

$Q$- set of all states

$\Sigma$- The alphabet used by the Finite State Auotmata

$T$- The alphabet used by the Stack

$T_0: T$- First letter in the Stack

$Q_0: Q$- Starting State

$\Delta: Q\times \Sigma\times T\times T^*\times Q$
A transition which will have an initial state, a letter the automata accepts, a letter it reads from the stack, a word it adds to the stack adn the final state

$F: 2^Q$- Final States


$L = \{w \mid \textbar w\textbar_a = \textbar w \textbar_b \}$
