# Kneser Graph
Let $X=$ set of all $3-$subsets of the set $[7]$
$|X|={7\choose 3}=35$ 
Represent such graphs has $J(7, 3, 0)$ 
which represents $J($ Size of the total set, size of the subset, interesection between subsets$)$


$\text{Aut}(J(7,3,0))=\text{Aut}(J(7,3,2))=S_{7}$
$\text{Aut}(J(7,3,1))=S_{8}$
