# Monotone Domination Order
---
>[!note] Definition
>Given a [[Preorder]] $\sqsubseteq$ on $A$. 
>We can define a *monotone domination order* $\preceq$ on $A*$ as follows
>$a_1,a_2\dots a_n \preceq b_1,b_2\dots b_m$ if there exists a strictly  increasing function $f:\{1\dots n\}\rightarrow \{1\dots m\}$ such that $a_i\sqsubseteq b_{f(i)}$ for all $i$

**Intuitively** I can pick the first element of $a$ and match with an element $b$. Then I pick the next element of $a$ and match it with an element of $b$ which is after the previous choice and so on.

An important *Lemma* for [[Well-Preorder|wqo]] is  
![[Higman's Lemma#^Lemma]]
