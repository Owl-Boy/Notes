title: Field
A Field is a commutative ring in which every element has its inverse. Equivalently, the set $F^\times = F \setminus \{0\}$ of non zero elements is an abelian group under multiplication.
```

The [[Characterisic of a field]] $F$, denoted $\text{ch}(F)$ is the smallest positive integer $p$ such that $p\cdot1_F=0$ if such $p$ exists, otherwise it is defined to be $0$.

Let $\varphi: F\to F'$ be a field homomorphism, then $\varphi$ is either identically $0$ or an injection. (because the kernel is an ideal in $F$ which is either $0$ or the ring itself.) 

If $K$ is a field containing the subfield $F$, $K$ is called the [[Extension Field]] of $F$ denoted by $K/F$ or by the diagram
$$
\begin{matrix}
K\\
\huge|\\
F
\end{matrix}
$$

$\alpha \in K$ is said to be _algebraic_ over $F$ if it is the root of some non-zero polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$. If not, $\alpha$ is called _Transcendental_ over $F$. If $\forall\alpha\in K$ is algebraic over $F$, $K$ is called an [[Algebraic Extension]] of $F$. 

If $K_1$ and $K_2$ are subfields of $K$, then the [[Composite Field| composite field]] of $K_1$ and $K_2$ denoted by $K_1K_2$, is the smallest subfield of $K$ which contains both $K_1$ and $K_2$. Similarly, the composite field of any collection of subfields of $K$ is the smallest subfield of $K$ which contains all the other ones.
