# Why Differential Equations
The theory of ordinary differential equation is one of the best basic tool of mathetical science. This theory makes it possible to study all evolutionary processes that posses the properties of _Determinacy, Finite-Dimentionality_ and _Differentiability_. 

A Process is called **Deterministic** if its entire future course and its entire past are uniquely determined by its state at the present time. The space of all states is called the **Phase Space**. Classical mechanics considers motions of systems which are deterministic. The motion of particles in quantum mechanics is not deterministic.The propogation of heat is semi-deterministic: The future is decided by the current state but the past is not.

A process is called **Finite Dimentional** if its phase space is finite dimentional, i.e, if the number of parameter neede to describe its states is finite. Like motion of particles and rigid bodies in classical mechanics. Motions of a fluid in fluid mechanics, the vibration of a string or a membrane, and the propogation of waves in optics and acoustics are examples of systems which cannot be described using a finite dimensional phase space.

A process is called **Differentiable** if is phase space has struction of a differentiable manifold, and the change of state is described by differentiable functions. So the coordinates and velocities of particles of a mechanical system change differentiably with time. The motion studied in impact theory do not change differentiably.

Thus motion of system in classical mechanics can be described using ordinanry differential equations, while quantum mechanics, elasticity theory, optics, acoustics and imact theory require other tools. 

The process of radio active decay and the process of population growth can also be described in terms of ordinary differential equations. 

Systems like these and much more can be very elegantly modelled by ordinary differential equations. Which makes Differential equations an important field of study.

The precise fomulation of the above principles requiers concepts like [[Phase Space]]
