#  Groups In First Order Logic
---

A **Group** is a tuple $\langle G,*,\epsilon\rangle$
Where $G$ is a set, $*$ is a *Binary Relation* on the set and $\epsilon\in G$ is a special element such that $\epsilon * x = x * \epsilon=x$ for all $x\in G$.
The Binary operator is also associative and every element has an inverse.

We can now model **Groups** using the following Language
Let $R=\emptyset, F=\{*\}, S=\{\epsilon\}$ and let $L=\langle R, F, S\rangle$ along with the following equations
- $\forall x\forall y\forall z\; (x*y)*z=x*(y*z)$
- $\forall x\; (x*\epsilon\equiv\epsilon*x)\land(\epsilon*x=x)$
- $\forall x\exists y\; x*y \equiv \epsilon$


The above three *First Order Equations* represent
- Associativity of $*$
- $\epsilon$ being the identity element for $*$
- Existence of the inverse of every element.

Any [[Semantics of First Order Logic#First Order Structures|First Order Structure]] for an above language can be interpreted as a group.
