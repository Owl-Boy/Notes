# Convergence of Fourier Series

```ad-note 
title: Theorem 
Suppose that $f$ is integrable on the circle, with $\hat{f}(n) = 0 \ \forall \ n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $f(\theta_0) = 0$ for all points of continuity $\theta_0$ of $f$.
```
### Proof:

### Corollary: 
Suppose $f$ is continuous on the circle, and the fourier series of $f$ converges absolutely i.e., $\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|\hat{f}(n)|$, then the fourier series converges uniformly to $f$, that is, $$\lim_{N\to\infty}S_N(f)(\theta) = f(\theta) $$ for all $\theta$.
