# $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ with the product topology
```ad-note
title:
$\mathbb{R}^{\omega} = \prod \limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{R}$. 

The topology on $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ is given by the basic open sets of the form: $\prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}U_{n}$ where each $U_{n} = (a,b) \subset \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ itself, such that all except finitely many $U_{n}$'s are $\mathbb{R}$.
```

### This space has the following properties:
- Hausdorff
- Locally compact
- Normal

# $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ with uniform topology
```ad-note
title:
The uniform topology is the topology given by the uniform metric.

The **uniform metric** is defined as follows:
$$
d(x,y) = \sup\limits_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \left\{ \min(1,|x_{n}-y_{n}|) \right\} 
$$

```

### This space has the following properties:
- Hausdorff
- Metrizable
- Normal

# $\mathbb{R}^{\omega}$ with the box topology 
```ad-note
title:
Box topo is the topo where the basic open sets are $\prod U_{\alpha}$ with each $U_\alpha$ open in the $X_\alpha$.
```

### This space has the following properties:
- Hausdorff
- Not metrizable (show that it doesn't satisfy sequence lemma)
