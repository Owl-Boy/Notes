# Phase Flow
let $U\subseteq \mathbb R$ be the domain and $\{g^t\}$ be a [[One Parameter Group Of Diffeomorphisms]]. Then the pair $(U,\{g^{t}\})$ is called a **Phase Flow**.*
For each **Phase Flow** There exists an associated [[Autonomous System|autonomous first order differential equation]] which is 
$$
\overline v(\overline x):=\frac{d}{dt}(g^{t}(\overline x))\bigg|_{t=0}
$$
And by fixing $\overline x_0$, consider the function $\varphi:I\to U$ defined as 
$$
\varphi(t)=g^t(\overline x_0)
$$
Which is the unique solution to the IVP with given phase flow $(U, \{g^{t}\})$ and phase velocity $\overline v$, and initial value $\overline x_0$.
