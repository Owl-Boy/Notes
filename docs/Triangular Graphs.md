# Triangular Graphs
Let $m$ be a positive integer. The **Triangular Graph** $T_{m}$ is the graph where $V={M\choose2}$ where $M=[m]$ with $A\sim B\iff |A\cap B|=1$ for $A, B\in V$ 

```ad-seealso
The **Triangular Graphs** is just the [[Line Graph]] of the **Complete Graph**
```

It is [[Strongly Regular Graphs|strongly regular]] with
$$
\begin{align*}
n&= {m\choose 2}\\
k&= 2(m-2)\\
a&= m-2\\
c&= 4
\end{align*}
$$

title:Peterson Creep
The Complement of the Traigular Grapth $T_{5}$ is a graph which is stronlgy regular with parameters $(10,3,0,1)$ Which is the _Peterson Graph_!
