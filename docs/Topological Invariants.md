# Topological Invariants
A property $\mathcal P$ of  a topological space $X$ is called a **Topological Invariant** if whenever $(X, \mathcal T_Y)$ and $(Y, \mathcal T_Y)$ are two homeomorphic topological spaces, one has property $\mathcal P$ if and only if the other has the property $\mathcal P$ .
Invariants give us a quick series of checks on wether two spaces can be homeomorphic: if we can identify a topological invariant that one space has and another does not, they cannot be homeomorphic.

The following properties are topological invariants:
1. $T_0$ or [[Kolmogorov Property]].
2. $T_1$ or [[Frechet Property]].
3. $T_2$ or [[Hausdorff Property]].
4. Having a particular Cardinality.
5. Seperability.
