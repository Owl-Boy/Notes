# Complexity Classes
The goal of complexity theory is to classify problems by their difficulty, we can classify problems into multiple complexity classes.

![[P Complexity Class#P]]

---
![[NP Complexity Class#NP]]
- $P\subseteq NP$ 
---
![[BPP Complexity Class#BPP]]
- $P\subseteq BPP$
---
The equality of **P** and **NP** and the equality of **P** and **BPP**, are two big unsolved problems in complexity theory.
![[DTIME(f) Complexity Class#DTIME(f)]]

---
![[NTIME(f) Complexity Class#NTIME(f)]]

---
![[EXP Complexity Class#EXP]]
