# Rank of a module
```ad-note
title:
For any integral domain R, the rank of an R-module M is the maximum number of R-linearly independent elements of M.
```

- A free R module isomorphic to $R^n$ has rank n.
- For any submodule N of a free R-module M, rank(N) is atmost rank(M). _(follows from the proposition given below)_
- If R is a field, then the rank of the module is just the dimension as a vector space over F.
- In general, an R module need not have a basis, even if it is torsion free.

```ad-note
title: Proposition
Let R be an integral domain, and let M be a free R-module of rank $n < \infty$. Then any n+1 elements of M are R-linearly dependent.
