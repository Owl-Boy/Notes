# Updatable Timed Automata

>[!note] Definition
>An  *Updatable Timed Automata* is a [[Timed Automata with Diagonal Constraints|d-timed automata]] with clock resets replaced with more general clock updates as defined below.

## Clock Updates
Let $X$ be a set of clocks. An *update* is an expression generated by the following grammar
$$
x:=c\quad\quad|\quad\quad x:=y+d
$$
where $x, y \in X,c\in\mathbb N,d\in\mathbb Z$.

>[!example] Example of an *updatable timed automata* 
> ![[Updatable Timed Automata.excalidraw]]
> The language for this automata is $\{(a^kb,\tau)\;:\;k\leq 10,\tau_{1}\leq \tau_{2}\dots \tau_{k}\leq \tau_{k+1}\}$ 

## Subclasses of Updatable Timed Automata
**Updatable Timed Automata** are in general more expressive than timed automata. One simple way to check is to check the untime their languages, It is simply the set of all [[Recursive and Recursively Eumberable Sets|recursive languages]]. This is because we can simulate [[Turing Machines]] in them which is discussed more in [[Emptiness for Updatable Timed Automata]].

So we restrict the updates and guards to reduce the power of **Updatable Timed Automata** in order to get properties like decidability back.

Some of these subclasses are:
1. [[Updatable Timed Automata with only x=c and x=y updates]]
2. [[Updatable Timed Automata without Diagonal Constraints and c in N]]
3. [[Updatable Timed Automata with only update being x=x-1]]

The expressive power of these subclasses can be summed up in the following table

|             | Diagonal Free   | Diagonal        |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| $x:=c,x:=y$ | Timed Automata  | Timed Automata  |
| $x:=y+c$    | Timed Automata  | More expressive |
| $x:=x-1$    | More expressive | More expressive |
