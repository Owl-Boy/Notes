# Line Graph
Given a Graph $G$, A line graph $L(G)$ is a graph such that for edge in $G$ there is a corresponding node in $L(G)$ and if two edges are adjacent in $G$ then the corresponding notes have an edge connecting them.

**Claim:** If $G_{1}\cong G_{2}$ then $L(G_{1})\cong L(G_{2})$ 

## Theorem
Let $K$ be a simple graph. The  $\exists G$ such that $L(G)=K$ iff for every vertex $v$ of $K$, $v$ is in atmost $2$ maximal cliques
