# Typed Combinatory Logic

Typed Combinatory Logic corresponds to [[Hilbert Style Proofs]] as the combinatory terms can be given the following types
$$
\begin{align*}
K &: \alpha\to \beta\to\alpha\\
S &: (\alpha\to\beta\to\gamma)\to(\alpha\to\beta)\to\alpha\to\gamma
\end{align*}
$$
and application works as modus ponens.

Since *Combinatory Logic* can be rewritten as *Lambda Calculus*. It enjoys all the properties of [[Simply Typed Lambda Calculus Syntax|Typed Lambda Calculus]]
