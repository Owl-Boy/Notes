# Splitting Fields
```ad-note
title: 
Let $K$ be a field, and $f \in K[x]$ be some nonconstant polynomial, there is a field extension $K_{1}/K$ in which $f(x)$ has a root $\alpha$. Then $f(x) = (x-\alpha)g(x)$ where $g \in K_1[x]$ and $\mathrm{deg}(g) = \mathrm{deg}(f)-1$. By applying the same process $n-1$ times. We obtain an extension $L$ where $f$ splits into linear factors$$
f(x) = c(x-\alpha_{1})(x-\alpha_{2})\dots(x-\alpha_{n})
$$ in $L[x]$.

We call the field $K(\alpha_{1}\dots \alpha_{n})$ that is generated by the roots of $f$ in $L$, a **splitting field** of $f$ over $K$.


Also note that $[K(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n) : K] \le (deg (f))!$.

#### The following theorem shows that splitting field of a polynomial is unique.

## Theorem 1
```ad-note
title:
Let $K$ be a field and $f(x)$ be nonconstant in $K[x]$. If $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are splitting
fields of $f(x)$ over $K$ then 
1) $[L_{1}:K] = [L_{2}: K]$ 
2) There is a field isomorphism $\phi : L_{1} \to L_{2}$ fixing all of $K$. 
3) The number of such isomorphisms $L_{1} \to L_{2}$ is at most $[L_1:K]$ 
```

#### To prove this, we need to prove a general case of this theorem.

## Theorem 2
```ad-note
title:
Let $K_{1},K_{2}$ be fields with $\sigma : K_{1} \to K_{2}$ an isomorphism between them. And let $f(x)$ be nonconstant in $K_{1}[x]$. If $L_{1}$ is a splitting field of $f(x)$ over $K_{1}$ and let $L_{2}$ be a splitting field of $(\sigma f)(x)$ over $K_{2}$ respectively then: 
1) $[L_{1}:K_1] = [L_{2}: K_2]$ 
2) $\sigma$ extends to an isomorphism $\sigma_2 : L_{1} \to L_{2}$ fixing all of $K$. 
3) The number of such extensions $L_{1} \to L_{2}$ is at most $[L_1:K_1]$ 
```

##### Proof:
Induction on $[L_{1}:K_{1}]$. 
$[L_{1}:K_{1}] = 1$ case is trivial.
$[L_{1}:K_{1}] > 1$:
1) Take a root of $\alpha$ of $f$ in $L_{1}$ which is not in $K_{1}$. Then, $K_{1}(\alpha)$ is a subfield of $L_{1}$.
2) Take the minimal poly of $\alpha$ over $K_{1}$, call this $\pi$.
3) Now suppose there was an isomorphism $\sigma_{2}$  from $L_{1}$ to $L_{2}$ that extended $\sigma$.
   Then $(\sigma_{2}\pi)(\sigma_{2}\alpha) = (\sigma \pi)(\sigma_{2}(\alpha)) = \sigma(\pi(\alpha)) = \sigma(0) = 0$. Hence, $\sigma_{2}$ takes $\alpha$ to roots of $\sigma \pi$.
4) Now we show that $\sigma \pi$ has a root in $L_{2}$. Since $\pi(x) | f(x)$ then $\sigma\pi(x) | \sigma f(x)$. Since $\sigma f$ splits in $L_{2}$, $\sigma \pi$ does too, and hence has a root $\alpha'$ in $L_{2}$.
5) Hence, we can extend $\sigma$ to $\sigma_{1} : K_{1}(\alpha) \to K_{2}(\alpha')$ where $\sigma_{1}$ is unique once the choice for $\alpha'$ has been made.
6) Now since $[L_{1}:K_{1}(\alpha)] < [L_{1}:K_{1}]$, we can induct (here $K_{1},K_{2}$ gets replaced by $K_{1}(\alpha), K_{2}(\alpha')$ respectively). This gives an extension of $\sigma$ to $\sigma_{2} : L_{1} \to L_{2}$, so we are done for 2. For 1, just see that $[K_{1}(\alpha):K_{1}] = [K_{2}(\alpha) : K_{2}]$.
7) For 3, we need to work a bit more and see that any extension $\sigma_{2}$ of $\sigma$ restricts to an isomorphism $K_{1}(\alpha) \to K_{2}(\sigma_{2}(\alpha))$.
   Where $\sigma_{2}(\alpha)$ is a root of $\sigma_{2}\pi$ where $\pi$ is some irreducible factor of $f$. So, the number of extensions to $K_{1}(\alpha)$ is $[K_{1}(\alpha) : K_{1}]$. And by induction, the number of extensions from $K_{1}(\alpha)$ to $L_{1}$ are at most $[L_{1}:K_{1}(\alpha)]$.
   
   This gives that the number of extensions $\sigma_{2}$ of $\sigma$ is at most $[K_{1}(\alpha) : K_{1}][L_{1}:K_{1}(\alpha)] =[L_{1}:K_{1}]$. 

#### Now Theorem 1 follows by putting $K_{1}=K_{2}=K, \sigma = id_{K}$.

#### NOTE:
In  the above proof, we can even show that the number of extensions $\sigma_{2}$, are infact equal to $[L_{1}:K_{1}]$. Since, if we assume this to be the induction hypothesis, then we can show that the number of extensions to $K_{1}(\alpha) \to K_{2}(\alpha')$ is **exactly** equal to $\mathrm{deg}(\pi)$ by showing that all roots of $\sigma \pi$ are distinct. Since if that's the case then there are $\mathrm{deg}(\sigma \pi)$ many possibilities of $\alpha'$, each giving a distinct isomorphism (this is possible when $\sigma \pi$ is _separable_).
Suppose two choices gave the same isomorphism, that would mean $K_{2}(\alpha_{1}') = K_{2}(\alpha_{2}')$, which would mean that between $K_{2}(\alpha_{1}')$ and $K_{2}(\alpha_{2}')$ there are two isomorphisms, one is just identity, and the other sends $\alpha_{1}'$ to $\alpha_{2}'$. This is a contradiction to the fact that there is unique isomorphism between $K(\alpha)$ and $K[x]/(f)$ for any irreducible $f$ and $\alpha$ a root of $f$.

## Theorem 3:
```ad-note
title:
Let $K_{1},K_{2}$ be fields with $\sigma : K_{1} \to K_{2}$ an isomorphism between them. And let $f(x)$ be nonconstant in $K_{1}[x]$. If $L_{1}$ is a splitting field of $f(x)$ over $K_{1}$ and let $L_{2}$ be a splitting field of $(\sigma f)(x)$ over $K_{2}$ respectively, then if $f(x)$ is separable then:
1) $[L_{1}:K_1] = [L_{2}: K_2]$ 
2) $\sigma$ extends to an isomorphism $\sigma_2 : L_{1} \to L_{2}$ fixing all of $K$. 
3) The number of such extensions $L_{1} \to L_{2}$ is exactly $[L_1:K_1]$ 
```
##### Proof:
Refer to the note above and Theorem 2's proof to show this.

### Corollary:
```ad-note
title:
If $L/K$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial then there are $[L:K]$ automorphisms of $L$ that fix the elements of $K$.
```

#### Note:
Let $F$ be a field. For a given integer $n$, there may or may not exist polynomials of degree $n$ in $F[X]$ whose splitting field has degree $n!$ â€” this depends on $F$.

For example, there do not exist such polynomials for $n>1$ if $F = \mathbb{C}$, nor for $n > 2$ if $F = \mathbb{R}$ or $F = \mathbb{F}_{p}$. 
- For $F = \mathbb{F}_{p}$, we can show that any irreducible poly of degree $d$ which has root $\alpha$ in a field extension of $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, has as roots $\alpha, \alpha^{p}, \alpha^{p^{2}}, \dots, \alpha^{p ^{d-1}}$. So the splitting field of a degree $d$ poly over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ will just be $\mathbb{F}_{p}(\alpha)$ of degree $d$.

However we can write down infinitely many polynomials of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ with splitting fields of degree $n!$.

# Examples
1) The extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{ 2 }, \sqrt{ 3 })/\mathbb{Q}$ is a splitting field of $(x^{2}-3)(x^{2}-2)$. 
   Its degree is 4, so there are 4 automorphisms that fix $\mathbb{Q}$.
   To find the automorphisms, just observe that $\sqrt{ 2 }$ can only go to $\pm \sqrt{ 2 }$, similarly $\sqrt{ 3 }$ can only go to $\pm \sqrt{ 3 }$. Thus there are 4 possibilities, but since we know that there are exactly 4 automorphisms, then all of these should work.
